Draft support message to Netlify:

Hi Netlify Support,

We're seeing consistent failures when uploading functions during production deploys from the Netlify CLI.

Details:
- Site: kpidashbd (https://kpidashbd.netlify.app)
- SiteId: 96034138-b959-429b-9369-34fdbc8a46be
- Netlify CLI user: theagentwo@gmail.com
- Local project path: C:\Users\theag\Documents\New-KPI-Dashboard
- Date/time (local): 2025-11-22 (see CLI timestamps in attached debug excerpt)

Reproduction steps:
1. Build the project (functions build with esbuild to `functions-dist/`)
2. Run: `npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --skip-functions-cache --no-build --debug`

Observed behavior:
- The CLI fails while uploading functions with a JSONHTTPError 500. Example payload:
  {"code":500,"message":"Failed to create function"}
- The error occurs even when uploading a minimal `functions-dist` containing only a tiny function (`debug-status.js`).
- Local `netlify dev` works and functions run locally.

Attachments:
- `debug-excerpt.txt` (CLI debug excerpt showing the 500 and stack trace)
- `site-info.txt` and `commands.txt`

Request:
- Please inspect server-side logs for the create-function calls originating from our account/site at the times shown and tell us why the API is returning 500.
- If there are any account-level or site-level restrictions (size, content, permissions) causing this, please advise how to fix or work around them.

Thanks,
The Dashboard Team
